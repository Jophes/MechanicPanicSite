                            We are a group of 3 students from the University Of Northampton, 2 of which with 4 other individuals attended a Game Jam named Brains Eden. At this event the team was given 48 hours to develop a game based on the theme of [THEME]. After this event 2 of the individuals wanted to continue working on the game to the state where it could be published and released to the public. Thus, after picking up another student to work on the game there are the team of 3 who are working on the game today.
